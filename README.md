# Travelling salesman problem solved by using genetic algorithms

### This problem finds the shortest path for a given graph
In the following exemple I used the algorithm on the berlin52 dataset with the following parameters : <br>
* Population size : 100 <br>
* Mutation factor : 30% <br>
* Number of generations : 1000 <br>
